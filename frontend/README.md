# Inspiration
The inspiration for this project came from the desire to create a comprehensive platform that enhances the campus experience for students at the University of Dundee. For us personally, we are all new students at the University of Dundee, and we understand the challenges and opportunities that come with starting university. We wanted to create a tool that would help students make the most of their time on campus and create a sense of community among students.
